      </h3>
        <ul>
          <h4>
        <li>Jeans with something white are something very classic and never fail, but it is also good to try with clothes that you have never used but that are a trend this year and discover what things favor you and what things do not.</li>
        </h4>
      </ul>
      <h3>
      <li><strong> Personal style</strong></li>
      </h3>
        <ul>
          <h4>
          <li>It's about finding your own style and exploiting it, but you don't have to look like other women. Try creating your style based on what is worn but adapting it your way.</li>
          </h4>
        </ul>
        <h3>
      <li><strong>Fair trends</strong></li>
       </h3>
        <ul>
          <h4>
          <li>There are thousands of things that are in fashion today, but you don't have to use all of them at the same time, try to find things that you like and that correspond to you.</li>
          </h4>
        </ul>
        <h3>
       <li><strong>Less is more</strong></li>
       </h3>
         <ul>
           <h4>
             <li>Think that a heavily loaded outfit is annoying and uncomfortable. Try to be simple in your looks by using basic garments that are unique thanks to the accessories</li>
           </h4>
         </ul>
         <h3>
           <li><strong>Quality</strong></li>
         </h3>
           <ul>
             <h4>
               <li>It is better to have few clothes but of quality, than to have everything that is worn but of very poor quality.</li>
             </h4>
           </ul>
    </ol>
